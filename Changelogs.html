        <li>We've added yet another new game mode: Mothership!</li>
        <li>Here are the basics:
            <ul>
                <li>There are two teams, so there are two Motherships that spawn in the corners of the map.</li>
                <li>Each Mothership has a name color which matches their team.</li>
                <li>Unlike Diep and main Arras Mothership, you can press H to control your team's Mothership.</li>

        <li>We're proud to announce that we're releasing a new server with a new game mode: 2 Team Domination!</li>
        <li>To keep it simple, the rules of Domination are simple:
            <ul>
                <li>5 different Dominators are scattered around the map, each with its own challenging characteristics.</li>
                <li>These Dominators spawn yellow, and will attack any tank. Yellow Dominators are considered "contested".</li>
                <li>If you kill one, you capture it into your team.</li>
                <li>If the opposing team kills your Dominator, it becomes "contested" again.</li>
                <li>Capture 4 Dominators, and you win the game! The arena closes and it all resets.</li>
            </ul>

        <li>To get to the new server, hover your mouse over the server name (above the name text box), scroll down, and select "2 Team Domination".</li>

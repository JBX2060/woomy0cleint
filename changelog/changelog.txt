Sire! Do you remember the Polyviral Vector? An unimaginable boss with the power to inject polyvectors? The polyvectors that forcibly makes tanks spawn polygons and kills them slowly...?
Yes, I believe so, soldier. Didn't the polygons combine their bodies, or, what remained of them into producing that monstrosity?
We've received info that the polygons are planning something much worse...
What could be more worse than the Polyviral Vector?
All we've gotten from our spies was:
  "The polygons are awakening. Worse than Polyviral. WZAZY"

All shall tremble in and undone and done
For their wrath beholds a walking nightmare
Their quest for redomination has begun.

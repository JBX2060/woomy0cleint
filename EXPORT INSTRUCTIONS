How do i add pictures as a file to folders?

The whole code needs to be exported to Github and Imported again to Glitch with the new files from Github
Also I finished the base of app.js
cool
I need a way to get the picture in without modifications or removing private. I don't have membership
this is an old project
cant
can u try?
Go to Tools
Then Press Import and Export

But you need to go to github first and create a repo with a README.md file
Then Go back to Tools and Import and Export and Select Export to Github
Put in the repo name that you made in Github
Then it will extract the code you added into github

IN GLITCH: If it doesn't show Export to Github, press Grant Access

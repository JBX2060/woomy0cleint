To help make mockups load faster, we can use minification using obfuscator.io. Minification just removes comments and renames variables but
obfuscation will help remove everything unnecessary out of the code, renames, and fixes memory leaks. Do it after publishing to Github.

Mockup Load Timing:
==============

8 seconds - With Obfuscation Method
11.8 seconds - Without the Obfuscation Method.
